# ROT-13

## Launching the program 

My program was built with Ruby (version 2.6.5). To launch the program type ```ruby interface.rb``` in the terminal.

## Files included

### rot-13.rb

This is the method which runs the basis of a ROT-13 algorithm, taking a string and number as inputs and replacing each letter with the nth letter after it. 

### interface.rb

This is used to interact with the user, allowing them to customise the rotation value (between 1 and 25) and enter a word or phrase of their choice. They will be given the option to either play again or quit.
